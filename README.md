IFT 220 Hello World


A little about me...

My name is Michael Crofts and I'm an IFT major at Arizona State University. I live in Nashville, Tennessee and work as a shift supervisor at Starbucks. I've been with Starbucks for 6 years and I have been studying at ASU for almost 2 years.

I'm adding a little more about me to make a 3rd commit/pull request. So here it is!
